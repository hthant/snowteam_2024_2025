Machine Learning Code for Snowflake Classification

Purpose: 
    Identify snowflakes using machine learning, with many models and GPU testing being considered and experimented on.
    End goal is to achieve an acceptable program that outperforms original model by Hein Thant through various
    hyperparameter sweeping techniques.
