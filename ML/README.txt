Machine Learning Code for Snowflake Classification

Purpose: 
    Identify snowflakes using machine learning, with many models and GPU testing being considered and experimented on.
    End goal is to achieve an acceptable program that outperforms original model by Hein Thant through various
    hyperparameter sweeping techniques.

How to run the code:
    IMPORTANT: Before executing any files, make sure to run "conda activate mascDB" first.

    Type the following lines into the terminal, depending on the options you want. You can also choose to create a .sh (bash)
    file that executes these commands sequentially (Look at GPU_test.sh for example):
    - "python mirrored.py":
        Runs "mirrored.py", outputs to terminal.
    - "python mirrored.py &> log-mirrored.txt":
        Runs "mirrored.py", prints output to "log-mirrored.txt".
    - "python mirrored.py &> log-mirrored.txt & disown":
        Runs "mirrored.py" in background, prints output to "log-mirrored.txt". Allows for other terminal operations
        without interrupting program execution.
    - "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=n python mirrored.py":
        Runs "mirrored.py" with GPU n being the only usable GPU to code, where n is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the chosen GPU.

    Useful commands:
    - "bash example.sh":
        Runs the bash script example.sh, much like the Python executions above. This is helpful when wanting to execute
        multiple terminal commands sequentially.
    - "watch -n n1 tail -n n2 log-mirrored.txt"
        Outputs real-time updates of log-mirrored.txt, where n1 is the refresh rate (seconds) and n2 is the number of
        lines visible per refresh. For example, n1 = 3 and n2 = 10 shows the last 10 lines of the file ever 3 seconds.
    - "nvtop"
        Tracks GPU and CPU usage. Helpful to check if GPUs are selected properly. Press the Q key to exit.
    - "btop"
        Tracks GPU and CPU usage, showing currently run programs. Helpful to check if program is actually running or has
        unexpectedly stopped. To forcibly stop a program, select it and press the K key to kill it. Press Q to exit.

        Text file to show output of mirrored.py, used in hyperparameter sweeping for output analysis.
    - log-central.txt:
        Similar to log-mirrored.txt, but for central.py.
    - GPU_test.sh:
        Bash script for running 2 Python files (particularly mirrored.py and central.py) sequentially and sending their
        respective outputs to each of log-mirrored.txt and log-central.txt.

        Each function has its descrption commenetd above it.
    - toKeras3.py:
        ยง transformTensor(arr):
            Takes arr, casts its elements to 32-bit (single precision) floating point values, subtracts each value
            by the mean of all the elements, divides the results by the standard deviation of the elements, then reshapes
            the resulting object into a 4D array of size [3, 300, 300, BATCHSIZE].
            Separately, a variable 'out' is created, which is a 4D array of size [0, 300, 300, 3] filled with 0's.
            In the for loop that runs from 0 until BATCHSIZE - 1 inclusive, a 'temp' variable is created by taking the
            ith index in the 4th dimension of arr. Then, 3 copies of the 'temp' are stacked vertically, and reshaped into
            a [3, 300, 300, 3] 4D object, then concatenates it into the 'out' variable declared outsdie the loop.
            'out' is then reshaped into a 5D object of size [BATCHSIZE, 3, 300, 300, 3]. Finally, 'out1', 'out2', and 'out3'
            are created, which take the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd index respectively of the reshaped 'out', and reshape them again into
            a 4D object of size [BATCHSIZE, 300, 300, 3], which are then returned by the function.
        ยง transformLabel(l):
            'l' in this case is typically a list of labels. These can be found in utils3.py as:
            CLASSNAMES = ['small_particle', 'columnar_crystal', 'planar_crystal', 'aggregrate', 'graupel', 'columnar_planar_combination']
            RIMINGNAMES = ['unrimed', 'rimed', 'densely_rimed', 'graupel-like', 'graupel']
            Takes the values of 'l', subtracts them by 1, casts them into 8-bit unsigned integers, then one-hot codes them.
            Used for the labels in utils3.py.
            Refer to Tensorflow documentation below for tf.one_hot.
            https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/one_hot?hl=en
        ยง class CustomTFDataset(tf.keras.utils.Sequence):
            This class takes in a Keras sequence that allows the images and labels to be passed onto the functions in the toKeras3.py file.
	    It is essential for making sure that the images and labels are compatible with TensorFlow and training the machine learning algorithm
	    does not cause any compatability issues.

	    //FIND LINK AND INSERT HERE//
            - __len__(self) -> int:
                Returns the length of the X_generator passed on to CustomTFDataset.
            - __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Tuple[Any, Any]:
                Takes the X_generator and y_generator objects, converts them to tensors and assigns them to
                X_batch and y_batch respectively. X_batch is then passed on to transformTensor, and y_batch is 
                passed on to transformLabel. The function returns the tuple of the two results from these
                operations.
                Refer to Tensorflow documentation below for tf.convert_to_tensor:

Issues and Solutions:
    Issue:    "train" method in "mirrored.py" does not work as intended. Error message is the following:
              "Input to reshape is a tensor with 64800000 values, but the requested shape has 8640000 [Op:Reshape]"
    Solution: "BATCHSIZE" variable in "mirrored.py" and "toKeras3.py" must match

    Issue:    OOM (Out Of Memory) can occur when setting "BATCHSIZE" to a number above the limit
    Solution: "BATCHSIZE" has to be <= 68 per GPU, so maximum for 3 GPUs running simultaneously is 204
